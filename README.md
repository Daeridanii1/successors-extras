## The Successors

Welcome to the plugin repository for the Successors, an alien faction for the open-source space game [Endless Sky](https://www.github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky). The Successors [have now been pull requested](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/10296) for inclusion to the base game: future development will be taking place here.

The Successors currently occupy their own map region in the far galactic south-southwest. An introductory storyline is implemented, including at least four mainline missions and several side missions. Numerous ships and outfits are included, some of which are legitimately obtainable through progressing the main story.

All-content plugin support for testing and development is provided by [Omnis](https://www.github.com/DarcyManoel/-Omnis).

For more information on lore and worldbuilding, please consult [the "masterdoc"](docs/masterdoc.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a development repository; you are free to use this plugin as part of "story" or "legitimate" gameplay, but the Successors' ships, outfits, missions, and map presence are subject to change.
