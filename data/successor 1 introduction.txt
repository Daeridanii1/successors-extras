			`After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. After a brief delay, the lead ship transmits an unintelligible hail to you and slowly proceeds to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure on the planet's coast, where the group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads. As the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your landing site.`
			`	The aliens here remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Those standing on dry land are joined by several others who slither out of shallow, water-filled pools in the spaceport to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
			`   After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground. They say something in a strange sharply flowing language, shimmering with waves of color, and then wait expectantly for you to reply.`

The other's skin flashes a bright blue and then they leave, gliding towards one of the interceptors now parked alongside your ship at the spaceport.`
			`   When they return, they are holding in one of their arms a small spherical device which they hand to the alien in charge, who then in turn offers it to you and burbles an unintelligible phrase with what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone. Several individuals in the crowd by now appear to be taking pictures of the two of you, and you can see more of them in the distance gliding and swimming towards your landing site.`

Several Successors, many well-dressed like before, are gathered in the pool, and while Sieasej takes to it happily, you can't help but wince a little as the frigid water floods your boots.`
			`	After a few minutes and other Successors have trickled in, the meeting begins in earnest. One of the Successors moves to the center of the pool and addresses you directly.`

			`	"Guest. House Seineq recognizes thy noble words, even if we hold no reason for belief in them. We will permit the others to let thee buy our trinkets, and we shall watch thee closely to see if thy word is matched in action."`
			`	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Sioeora calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives.

event "learned predecessor planet history"
	planet "Kella-Uuoru-Sossa"
		description "This is the ancestral homeworld of the Successor species. The spatial anomalies that now dominate this system have scoured its surface with radiation and evaporated most of its once-extensive oceans. The great cities of the Predecessors' empire are now devoid of all organic life; many of them remain as pristine and gleaming as the on the days they were abandoned. Caustic dust chokes the lower atmosphere of the planet, and your ship's sensors alert you to the presence of several sandstorms at other locations on the planet's surface. It would be wise not to get caught in one."
		spaceport "The planet's main spaceport endures proudly even after thousands of years of disuse. Grand walls and cavernous vaulted ceilings rise hundreds of meters above your ship, some scarred by weapons fire, others distorted by heat or radiation. One flock of small cleaning drones continually polish the sand-worn floors, while others wander about aimlessly, devoid of purpose or direction."
	planet "Osolaa-Val-Mavra"
		description "The moon of Osolaa-Val-Mavra was one of the first worlds of the Predecessors to evacuate as a consequence of the deterioration of their space. House Sejra ran massive transport ships for seven years to and from the surface in an effort to move its citizens offworld and into neighboring systems. By the time they were done, Sejra's coffers were dry and its government on the brink of collapse, and the citizens it had gone to such effort to relocated were stranded in systems that were starting to show the same signs of decay as their one-time home. The desolate habitation trench and ice-covered surface of the moon are testaments to Sejra's folly; of trying to escape something they did not understand and had no hope of stopping."
	planet "Raaqa-Uur-Kaav"
		description "The one-time ancestral home of House Kaatrij is one of the few worlds of the Predecessors that remains relatively habitable. Its large forests have fluorished even in the absence of Kaatrij's intentional ecoengineering, and the enduring remains of the moon's cities are slowly but surely being consumed by the nature that surrounds them. While the advanced materials composing them resist decay even on a timescale of thousands of years, the tender shoots of green life nontheless quietly demonstrate their supremacy over the unmaintained artificial."
		spaceport `What was once this moon's spaceport is now a field of flowers. The landing pad upon which your ship rests has been overtaken by a host of tall blue ribbon-like blossoms for which the Successor name translates to something along the lines of "thread lilies". Nearer what once was the main body of the port, millenia-old flowerboxes are dense with spiky orange blooms that recede when touched and shed seed pods onto the empty walkways, where they are eventually snapped up by the wild gossamer-winged "Kijra"-pets which, like the moon as a whole, have thrived in the absence of their Predecessor masters.`
	planet "Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej"
		description "Once an important industrial planet for the High Houses of the core systems, Cavasaa-Vasa-Tej was a hub for the mining of rare elements and for the growth of exotic metal in the superheated corona of the Kasii-Cavaasa star. Without maintenance, most of the stellar metallic gardens have long since fallen into Kasii-Cavaasa's outer layers, but the few that have survived by chance are now completely overgrown with threads of hyperdense alloy; enough to supply the facilities of Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej's industry for years, if they were still operational."

		conversation
			`Compared to most of the spaceports you have been to in Successor space, this one is dingy, crowded, and uncomfortable. Most of the Successors you see look equally dirty and unhappy, and the majority of the few ships you've noticed landing are painted in a different, darker shade of red.`
			`	Would you like to ask someone here about this place?`
			choice
				`	(Yes.)`
				`	(No.)`
					defer
			`	You approach one of the crew members disembarking from one of the red-painted ships, who, as you draw closer, you see bears several large burns and scars.`
			`	"Excuse me, I was wondering if you could tell me about this place. It seems different to the rest of Successor space I've been through."`
			`	The Successor looks over at the spaceport for a moment before grunting quietly and deciding to reply. Their voice is lower and darker than that of most Successors you have heard, and their skin changes color and texture rapidly, almost with every word.`
			`	"Thou art the alien vis'tor brought by the Old Houses, art thou not? Their 'noble guest' whom they parade around with such delight?"`
			choice
				`	(Next.)`
			`	You reply to the affirmative, despite the accusation of being "paraded around," and the Successor grunts again; with approval or disgust you cannot tell. They lean against one of the cargo containers on the spaceport floor and continue,`
			`	"So then thou art an another indolent fool, no doubt decieved by their fine promises, of wealth and power so long as you toe the line? Well, look around and see the value of their noble word! The Houses care but naught for you or I or all of them." The Successor gestures to the crowd in a broad sweeping motion.`
			choice
				`	"Who are they?"`
					goto who
				`	"I don't think of myself as a fool."`
			`	"Then thou art doubly so, because thy time within this space is new and short and so the thoughts contained within thy brain are like those of a child, still blind to the world. But keep thy friends if they appear so kind; and take the time to recollect what I have said when in thy back their dagger nests."`
			`	With that, the Successor leaves, rising from the cargo containers and heading silently towards the spaceport.`
				decline

			label who
			`	"They are the outcasts of the Houses New, who, like the rest, were forced here when the old empire crumbled into ash. But while the rest of the New Houses had ample wealth to move and grow into their new domains, not all of us were able to escape this intermediary place they shoved us while we waited. A thousand years and still they paint us with their scorn and demonize our yearning to be free."`
			choice
				`	"Free?"`
					goto free
				`	"Thank you. I have no more questions."`
			`	"Thou would be wise, if thou possesses that rare art, to keep and guard thy back agaist thy new and treacherous 'friends.'`
			`	Or don't. Another buried fool makes little difference."`
			`	With that, the Successor leaves, rising from the cargo containers and heading silently towards the spaceport.`
				decline
			label free
			`	"Free, or freer than Old and New permit. The People's Houses stand not for the rich and those of noble blood, but for the true and honest heirs of that which was."`
			`	The Successor looks over to the spaceport, before returning their attention to you for the last time.`
			`	"Thou would be wise, if thou possesses that rare art, to keep and guard thy back agaist thy new and treacherous 'friends.'`
			`	Or don't. Another buried fool makes little difference."`
			`	With that, the Successor leaves, rising from the cargo containers and heading silently towards the spaceport.`
