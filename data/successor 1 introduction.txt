			`After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. After a brief delay, the lead ship transmits an unintelligible hail to you and slowly proceeds to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure on the planet's coast, where the group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads. As the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your landing site.`
			`	The aliens here remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Those standing on dry land are joined by several others who slither out of shallow, water-filled pools in the spaceport to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
			`	After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground. They say something in a strange sharply flowing language, shimmering with waves of color, and then wait expectantly for you to reply.`

			`	When they return, they are holding in one of their arms a small spherical device which they hand to the alien who seems to be in charge, who then in turn offers it to you and burbles an unintelligible phrase with what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone.

Eventually, Sieasej responds, and does so even more slowly and carefully than previously. "The scions of House Sioeora have made it known to the others in the High Houses that thou art a guest in their space and that thou shalt proceed under their protection. Thou may'st explore those of our worlds which thou may, and which permit thee access. Without the use of our language, though, thou shalt find few opportunities to do more than observe.

With this, Saajret and their escort return to the vehicle, which glides back into the lake. By the time that the <ship> is ready to take off, the ripples on the water have almost entirely dissapated and the first glimmers of sunlight are creeping over the distant hills.`

			`Once you have sat down at the spaceport, you are met by another group of Successor naval officers. You notice that this group appears even more diverse than the last, representing several different uniform styles and liveries. Unifying them all is a small white and blue pin attached to their outfits; one that does not correspond to the insignia of any of the High Houses. The officers guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers if it even carried those in the first place.`
			`	Several minutes later, the monorail deposits you at an especially large and well-decorated complex that swarms with both military and well-dressed civilians, some of whom appear so opulent and bejeweled that you suspect their personal effects are worth more than your ship. Each of them without exception wears the same white and blue insignia as your escorts, though many have incorporated it into their clothes' design or even display it as a pattern in skin coloration.`
			`	As your escort peels off into the crowd, you see a familiar face in the distance: Sieasej, the Successor scholar, who visibly perks up when they see you and approaches.`
			`	"Captain! Thou hast arrived at a fortuitous time! There are still some minutes before this day's meetings—including thy own audience with the Houses—are scheduled to begin." `

			`	"This is a diplomatic world for representatives of the High Houses to meet in council, resolve disputes, bicker over policy, and I suspect in as it shall be in thy own case, to offer special dispensation to citizens. I had told thou when we first met that they would be keeping their eyes upon thee, and since they have summoned thou here today, they must clearly want to involve thee in the next stage of their plans."`

				`	"I see. We'd better begin, then."`
					goto start
				`	"What are you doing here?"`

			`	Sieasej briefly turns a shade of green in a display you might almost characterize as blushing. "I was summoned. I suspect the Houses wish to reflect on my involvement as well."`
			choice
				`	"Indeed. I'm ready to begin, then."`
					goto start
			label start
			`	"Good! We would be wise to be early."`
			`	Together with Sieasej, you make your way to one of the smaller rooms branching off from the lobby. The doors open to reveal a garden-like area, filled with large long-leafed plants surrounding a centrally-located depression half-filled with water. Several Successors, many well-dressed like before, are gathered in the pool, and while Sieasej takes to it happily, you can't help but wince a little as the frigid water floods your boots.`
			`	After a few minutes and other Successors have trickled in, the meeting begins in earnest. One of the Successors moves to the center of the pool and addresses you directly.`
			`	"Captain. House Sioeora, who has supported thee with the gift of our translation device, and continues to recognize thy potential as an ally, wishes to recognize the good thy have done in our space, and proposes thy be awarded purchase rights for our general technology."`
			`	That representative then returns to the outer rim of the circle and another takes the center, this time facing the representative who just spoke.`
			`	"House Sioeora. House Chydiyi recognizes thy perspicacity and the value demonstrated by the captain, and supports thy proposal. The captain has proven themselves a valuable ally."`
			`	A third representative now takes the center position, addressing the two previous speakers.`
			`	"Houses Sioeora and Chydiyi. House Seineq proposes this alien be given no further rights nor gifts until they have proved themselves neutral. The Old Houses, which Sioeora and Chydiyi do today here represent, doth clearly seek to sway the alien's favor through brib'ry and deceit, and House Seineq stands with the New Houses in opposing this corruption."`
			`	That representative then returns to the edge of the circle, where they continue to eye you with suspicion. There is a pause in the conversation.`
			choice
				`	(Remain silent.)`
					goto silent
				`	"I have no interest in taking sides."`
					goto no
			label no
			`	This sparks some murmuring among the gathered Successors, both the representatives themselves and the other, quieter members who continue to stand around the periphery of the pool. There is no direct reply for some time until, after what seems like several minutes, the representative from House Seineq returns to the center and speaks.`
			`	"Guest. House Seineq recognizes thy noble words, even if we hold no reason for belief in them. We will permit the others to let thee buy our trinkets, and we shall watch thee closely to see if thy word is matched in action."`
			`	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Sioeora calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Sioeora and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and Seineq abstains from the vote, remaining at the rim of the pool, inspecting your behavior closely. The representative from Sioeora then promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
			`	"This is the mark of our diplomats and our symbol of trust and cooperation. Our people may remain wary of an alien in their midst, but wherever thou displays this, it shall be known that thou hast recieved the blessing of the High Houses in council and that they made trade with you in amity and without fear. Do not abuse this trust."`
			`	With a somewhat suspicious air, Sioeora then leaves the room, followed by the other representatives and gathered members, all of whom keep their eyes focused on you on the way out. Eventually, when only ones remaining are Sieasej and yourself, you pin the insignia on your jacket beside the translation device and exit as well, when you are directed back to the monorail station.`

			`Compared to most of the spaceports you have been to in Successor space, this one is dingy, crowded, and uncomfortable. Most of the Successors you see look equally dirty and unhappy, and the majority of the few ships you've noticed landing are painted in a different, darker shade of red.`

			`	"Excuse me, I was wondering if you could tell me about this place. It seems different to the rest of Successor space I've been through."`
			`	The Successor looks over at the spaceport for a moment before grunting quietly and deciding to reply. Their voice is lower and darker than that of most Successors you have heard, and their skin changes color and texture rapidly, almost with every word.`

			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"You could say so."`
			`	Despite the accusation of being "paraded around," the Successor grunts again at your response; with approval or disgust you cannot tell. They lean against one of the cargo containers on the spaceport floor and continue,`
			`	"So then thou art another indolent fool, no doubt deceived by their fine promises, of wealth and power so long as you toe the line? Well, look around and see the value of their noble word!
