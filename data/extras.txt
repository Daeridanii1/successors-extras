### EXTRAS: Content I don't plan on including in an initial PR but I wanted to make anyway. Spoiler territory for how I might (plan to) develop the story.

ship `Kijra-Khora`
	### An over-powered, over-gunned light warship intended as a potential unique reward for a storyline about House Kaatrij. Appropriate acquisition would be substantially after acquiring the High Houses license. Could be contrasted against another option (choose one or the other), perhaps a small selection of Predecessor-era outfits?
	### NOTE: The Blender model is rigged for movable nacelles, but this can't be achieved in main until we get some sort of context-sensitive ship animation support; see issue #4991 and PR #8797

	description `Named for the gossamer-winged birds of House Kaatrij's homeworld, the "Kijra-Khora" is the first truly new and original warship design employed by the Successors in nearly two thousand years. Broadly patterned after the fast and stealthy hit-and-run craft employed by Kaatrij's Predecessors in their destructive runs against Point Drive production facilities, the "Kijra-Khora" incorporates the House's recently-recovered cloaking technology and sports a fearsome weapons layout.`
	description `	The "Kijra-Khora" also has two mobile nacelles that can be deployed in combat to present additional weapons hardpoints, and can be retracted while docking or in hyperspace for additional protection. The nacelles also automatically retract when cloaking; this reduces the size of the cloaking field that must be generated, improving the overall efficiency of the system.`

	description `	These generate a so-called "fast" cloak, relatively inefficient but facilitating rapid cloaking and decloaking cycles, perfect for dancing in and out of sight while under fire. A complex exhaust suppression system allows for the use of afterburners while under cloak, at the cost of generating additional heat buildup within the vessel.`

	description `	 House Kaatrij's first foray back into cloaking technology is based on recovered data stashed away on Raaqa-Uur-Kaav before the fall. To support the massive energy requirements of this technology, power is drawn directly from the Vujlet's shield grid while active.`

	description `With the rediscovery of their shield-hungry cloaking technology, House Kaatrij has begun producing these small modifier units which divert shields directly to non-defensive systems like engines and cloaks. This closer integration reduces energy losses but also entirely prevents generated shields from intercepting incoming damage.`
	description `	Though designed for use with Kaatrij's exclusive cloaking technology, the usefulness of this outfit for powering general Successor afterburners has led Kaatrij to offer this to civilians as well.`
