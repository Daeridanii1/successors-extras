### EXTRAS: Content I don't plan on including in an initial PR but I wanted to make anyway. Spoiler territory for how I might (plan to) develop the story.

ship `Kijra-Khora`
	### An over-powered, over-gunned light warship intended as a potential unique reward for a storyline about House Kaatrij. Appropriate acquisition would be substantially after acquiring the High Houses license. Could be contrasted against another option (choose one or the other), perhaps a small selection of Predecessor-era outfits?
	### NOTE: The Blender model is rigged for movable nacelles, but this can't be achieved in main until we get some sort of context-sensitive ship animation support; see issue #4991 and PR #8797

	description `Named for the gossamer-winged birds of House Kaatrij's homeworld, the "Kijra-Khora" is the first truly new and original warship design employed by the Successors in nearly two thousand years. Broadly patterned after the fast and stealthy hit-and-run craft employed by Kaatrij's Predecessors in their destructive runs against Point Drive production facilities, the "Kijra-Khora" incorporates the House's recently-recovered cloaking technology and sports a fearsome weapons layout.`
	description `	The "Kijra-Khora" also has two mobile nacelles that can be deployed in combat to present additional weapons hardpoints, and can be retracted while docking or in hyperspace for additional protection. The nacelles also automatically retract when cloaking; this reduces the size of the cloaking field that must be generated, improving the overall efficiency of the system.`
