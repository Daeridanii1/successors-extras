### EXTRAS: Content I don't plan on including in an initial PR but I wanted to make anyway. Spoiler territory for how I might (plan to) develop the story.

ship `Kijra-Khora`
	### An over-powered, over-gunned light warship intended as a potential unique reward for a storyline about House Kaatrij. Appropriate acquisition would be substantially after acquiring the High Houses license. Could be contrasted against another option (choose one or the other), perhaps a small selection of Predecessor-era outfits?
	### NOTE: The Blender model is rigged for movable nacelles, but this can't be achieved in main until we get some sort of context-sensitive ship animation support; see issue #4991 and PR #8797

	description `Named for the gossamer-winged birds of House Kaatrij's homeworld, the "Kijra-Khora" is the first truly new and original warship design employed by the Successors in nearly two thousand years. Broadly patterned after the fast and stealthy hit-and-run craft employed by Kaatrij's Predecessors in their destructive runs against Point Drive production facilities, the "Kijra-Khora" incorporates the House's recently-recovered cloaking technology and sports a fearsome weapons layout.`
	description `	The "Kijra-Khora" also has two mobile nacelles that can be deployed in combat to present additional weapons hardpoints, and can be retracted while docking or in hyperspace for additional protection. The nacelles also automatically retract when cloaking; this reduces the size of the cloaking field that must be generated, improving the overall efficiency of the system.`

	description `	These generate a so-called "fast" cloak, relatively inefficient but facilitating rapid cloaking and decloaking cycles, perfect for dancing in and out of sight while under fire. A complex exhaust suppression system allows for the use of afterburners while under cloak, at the cost of drawing additional power from the shield grid.`

outfit "Multimodal Armor: S-Vu"
	### Stealth armor that allows for retrofitting Vujleten. More efficient than the Kijra-Khora cloak but slower and does not offer afterburning.

	description `An advanced shield generator developed by House Kaatrij for their newly-rediscovered cloaking ships, the "Kajra" operates in an unusual but undeniably effective fashion. By delivering a vast amount of power along the same channels as the ship's cloaking systems, the "Kajra" can achieve a pace of regeneration that outstrips even the rapidly- recharging shield cortices of the High Houses. However, the large majority of this can only be conducted while the vessel it is equipped on is cloaked, and the process substantially interferes with standard shield generation equipment.`
	description `	Many of Kaatrij's captains still prefer to stick with the more time-proven shield cortices on their vessels, but many of the House's more adept and confronting pilots have come to enjoy the higher risk and reward that the "Kajra" offers.`

	description `The apex of modern Successor shield technology, the "Sosrue" allows a cloaked vessel to recover with startling rapidity, though one of these units draws more power than most reactors can produce. It bears the name of a deep-sea dwelling creature known for hunting from the shadows anything that bears light. Long thought extinct, relegated only to the imaginary stories told by parents to their children, the genetic code of the Sosrue was preserved, among others, in a sealed vault once owned by the old House Kaatrij.`
