	description "While today the planet is geologically stable, it experienced major tectonic shifts in the past, folding the planet's surface into a number of visually spectacular canyons and mountain ranges. Since it serves such an important political role, tectonic activity on this planet is closely monitored, and even though there have been no major earthquakes since the Successors settled here, most of the buildings here are built to withstand even large and destructive geological shifts."
	spaceport "Surprisingly small for a planet of this importance, the spaceport on Aava-Aasa-Khora is composed of a number of small buildngs made out of surprisngly flexible materials. While the sensation of the landing pad bowing under your ship's weight is unsettling to say the least, it shows no signs of damage or structural fatigue."
	spaceport "The inside of the spaceport is very similar, with soft, rounded shapes, and flexible building materials. The floor seems to sink a little as you step on it, almost like it is actually a viscous liquid rather than a solid material."

	description `Iyra-Ijasa-Iret is a pure water world, with no solid land anywhere upon its surface. Despite this, it hosts a relatively sizable population of Successors, most living in several sprawling underwater cities that dot the shallows, but some in much deeper and more pressure-resistant enclaves closer to the ocean floor. The moon is revered throughout Successor space for its undersea beauty; on the side of the moon that faces the gas giant which it orbits, huge plumes of bioluminescent plankton stream up towards the surface from the deep ocean in a daily feeding cycle the Successors call the "Ribbons of Iret."`
	spaceport `The spaceport resembles a group of enormous bubbles in the ocean near the equator; translucent, hemi-spherical hangars protrude from the water, cracking open like the petals of flowers to allow ships to enter and depart. Once inside, all the hangars are connected by a dense web of corridors and small, spherical rooms. Many are just as water-filled as the port's surroundings, and about half of the Successors you see throughout the spaceport are partially or entirely submerged.`

Beneath the permafrost lie rich deposits of rare earth elements and heavy metals that have formed and supported a highly self-contained economy, with entire production lines from raw material to final product contained within this single planet. Since many of the minerals mined here are integral for the production of the Successors' advanced composite materials, the New Houses keep a tight grip here, funneling many of the end products into their shipyards and construction projects."

Some of their former citizens were folded into House Kaatriij, but the rest, the majority, were to temporarily habitate here. Now, many years later, their descendants largely still do.`
	description `	The station, by now crowded and in disrepair, is technically the property of the Old Houses, but is far outside their jurisdiction, so it ends up as de facto stateless as its inhabitants.  Without a claim to any other citizenship, those inhabitants have formed the so-called "People's Houses," semi-familial groups that they laud as effective democratic governments but which are denigrated by most in the High Houses as little more than gangs of populist outlaws shielded by stale treaties.`
	spaceport `You wouldn't really call the landing area here a "spaceport:" it seems to be just an especially large cargo bay refitted to hold a handful of ships. In sharp contrast to most of the Successor facilities you've visited, it is grimy, dingy, and uncomfortably claustrophobic - throngs of Successors squeeze in between crowded starships, overflowing cargo containers, and strewn-about equipment, and most of these items display bullet holes, scorch marks, or other conditions not evocative of confidence.`
	spaceport "At the edges of the spaceport, several semi-obfuscated elevators and blast doors lead out into the rest of the station. While most of these, you presume, lead to residential areas, some seem to be servicing the seedier side of the population, and you can't help but wonder how much of the spaceport's operations are taking place behind closed doors."

For the highly familial Successors, this is a relatively small proportion, and consequently the planet only supports around twenty thousand inhabitants, though it has the highest population growth of any planet in Successor space. Most agree that this is a result of frustration with the bickering between the high houses, but it is commonly joked that it is instead a consequence of supposed especially amorous tendencies among the local population."

Despite this categorization, House Aqrabe has remained neutral in most of the Successors' conflicts over the millenia, and continues to present itself as an unbiased and politically uncommitted member of the High Houses which, combined with the central position of this star system, has led House Aqrabe to form strong connections with the New Houses as well as the Old."

	description "The landscape here is marked by gently rolling hills and the occasional pond. Your sensors remark that the atmosphere outside, while oxygen-rich, is too thin to safely breathe, and while you see a preponderance of hardy plant life, there are no animals to be seen."

	attributes crime station successor uninhabited
	landscape land/loc3
	description "Although briefly used as a small-scale shipyard several hundred years ago, this station was eventually abandoned by the High Houses because of its inconvenient location and altogether poor construction. There are occasional rumors about criminals using it as a bolt-hole or a place to hide contraband, but few Successors have the desire to go and check."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is cavernous but empty, riddled with voids where vast pieces of machinery have been removed. A layer of dust covers the ground; it is disturbed in some locations with what look like trails, suggesting this place may not be entirely unused."

	landscape land/myrabella0
	description "Despite the verdant and often bioluminescent life on its surface, the atmosphere of this planet is highly toxic to the Successors' biochemistry, and so they have made no permanent settlements here. While it is occasionally visited by the odd few tourists who don't mind having to wear an isolation suit, its distance from the majority of Successor space means that the Successors largely leave it alone."

	description "This planet is being surveyed to establish its potential as a new settlement location for the New Houses. Although its gravity is somewhat high for Successor tastes, it has a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a cool and watery surface. The first few settlers are scheduled to arrive here in a few years, once the planetary surveys are complete and have declared it safe and geologically stable."

	landscape land/forest5
	description "Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa's atmosphere is unusually thick for a planet of its size, and contains a very high concentration of carbon monoxide, which, while harmless to the Successors because of their different biochemistry, is highly toxic to humans. Nonetheless, it supports a rich and biodiverse planetary ecosystem, with large jungles straddling its equatorial regions that give way to strikingly beautiful mountain ranges near the poles. It serves as both one of the most popular tourist locations in Successor space, and as a major shipyard planet for the New Houses."
	description "Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa is also the seat of power of House Seineq, one of the New Houses."
	spaceport "You take care to equip a respirator before exiting your ship."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is large and busy, situated on a platform suspended on poles above one of the equatorial jungles. Because of the thick atmosphere, much of the transport in and out is by air, and there is a near-constant drone of airplane and airship engines layered over the normal spaceport chatter. Several large tourist groups are moving to and fro, and while some regard you with surprise, most take no notice of you or your ship, already focused on their upcoming tour or expedition."
