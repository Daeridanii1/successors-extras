	description `	While today the planet is geologically stable, it experienced major tectonic shifts in the past, folding the planet's surface into a number of visually spectacular canyons and mountain ranges. Since it serves such an important political role, tectonic activity on this planet is closely monitored, and even though there have been no major earthquakes since the Successors settled here, most of the buildings here are built to withstand even large and destructive geological shifts.`

While the sensation of the landing pad bowing under your ship's weight is unsettling, to say the least, it shows no signs of damage or structural fatigue.`

	description `	The station, by now crowded and in disrepair, is technically the property of the Old Houses, but is far outside their jurisdiction, so it ends up as de facto stateless as its inhabitants. Without a claim to any other citizenship, those inhabitants have formed the so-called "People's Houses," semi-familial groups that they laud as effective democratic governments but which are denigrated by most in the High Houses as little more than gangs of populist outlaws shielded by stale treaties.`

In sharp contrast to most of the Successor facilities you've visited, it is grimy, dingy, and uncomfortably claustrophobic - throngs of Successors squeeze in between crowded starships, overflowing cargo containers, and strewn-about equipment, and most of these items display bullet holes, scorch marks, or other conditions not evocative of confidence.`
