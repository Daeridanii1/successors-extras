### EXTRAS: Content I don't plan on including in an initial PR but I wanted to make anyway. Spoiler territory for how I might (plan to) develop the story.

outfit "Stealth Plating: Kijra-Khora"
	### Advanced stealth armor for the Kijra-Khora. Fast and offers afterburner usage, but drains a lot of shields.

	description `Advanced stealth plating and supporting systems designed for the Kijra-Khora light warship, applied as multimodal armor.`
	description `	These generate a so-called "fast" cloak that is relatively inefficient but facilitates rapid cloaking and decloaking cycles, perfect for dancing in and out of sight while under fire. A complex exhaust suppression system also allows for the use of afterburners while under cloak, greatly enhancing mobility and improving combat effectiveness.`

outfit "Stealth Plating: Vujlet"
	### Stealth armor that allows for retrofitting Vujleten. More efficient than the Kijra-Khora cloak but slower and does not offer afterburning.

	description `Stealth plating and supporting systems designed for the Vujlet light warship, applied as multimodal armor.`
	description `	 Without the benefit of their former production facilities from years past, the cloaking capabilities that House Kaatrij have maintained have needed to maximize their efficiency and reliability; as a consequence, their modern efforts are almost entirely ship-specific. To support the massive energy requirements of this technology, power is drawn directly from the Vujlet's shield grid while active.`


outfit `"Kajra" Stealth Shielding`
	### Shield generator specifically designed for Successor cloaking vessels. Massive shield regen under cloak, at the cost of drawing a lot of power and fuel, and reducing the effectiveness of standard shield regen outfits.

	description `An advanced shield generator developed by House Kaatrij for their cloaking ships, the Kajra operates in an unusual but undeniably effective fashion. By delivering a vast amount of power and hyperspace fuel catalyst along the same channels as the ship's cloaking systems, the Kajra can achieve a pace of regeneration that outstrips even the rapidly-recharging shield cortices of the High Houses. However, this can only be performed while the vessel it is equipped on is cloaked, and the process also interferes with standard shield generation equipment.`
	description `	Many of Kaatrij's captains prefer to stick with the more consistent and time-proven shield cortices on their vessels, but some of the House's more adept and confronting pilots have come to enjoy the more active style that the Kajra promotes.`

	description `The Sosrue takes its name from the monster of a traditional Kaatrij children's poem, evoking the creature's ravenous hunger and shrouded nature, and perhaps also some whimsy on the part of House Kaatrij's engineers:`
	description `	"Beware the Sosrue, cloaked in black, / Its teeth and claws agnash! / Make still thy heart, and quell thine arms, / Its lightless ears shall spy a flail! / By the bubbling of thy struggled folly, / Return above whilst thou still may! / ..."`

The "Asja" is a highly integrated fusion power system, featuring a top-of-the-line stellarator reactor directly connected to high-density batteries and a complex shield modulation system that substantially reduces shield power usage while only slightly reducing regeneration rate.`

	description `This outfit uses a small amount of hyperspace fuel and a large amount of energy to catalyze the generation of antiprotons, which it then ejects in a cone in front of the craft using it. Though these inflict only very minor damage, the annihilation events they produce upon contacting a target are highly visible to starship sensors, allowing the device to be used as an inelegant but effective way of pinpointing the location of a cloaked vessel.`
	description `   As the Successors have not employed cloaking technology in over a thousand years, anti-cloaking equipment like this has mostly remained unused, sitting in archives and slowly decaying.`
