	planet "Iyra-Ijasa-Iret"
		description `Iyra-Ijasa-Iret is a pure water world, with no solid land anywhere upon its surface. Despite this, it hosts a relatively sizable population of Successors, most living in several sprawling underwater cities that dot the shallows, but some in much deeper and more pressure-resistant enclaves closer to the ocean floor. The moon is revered throughout Successor space for its undersea beauty; on the side of the moon that faces the gas giant which it orbits, huge plumes of bioluminescent plankton stream up towards the surface from the deep ocean in a daily feeding cycle the Successors call the "Ribbons of Iret."`

	planet "Kua-Oa-Aava"
		description "The Old Houses have established several refueling and restock facilities on Aava-Aasa-Khora's moon to increase the speed at which they can service their warships by taking advantage of the additional space and low gravity the moon provides. While nominally open to the public, the vast majority of the facilities here are devoted entirely to military use, and the civilian areas are mostly intended to make sure that no ships without clearance will become stranded in this system."
		spaceport "The spaceport here is tiny and barebones, offering only minimal services. The few Successors you see are wearing military uniforms and remain polite and courteous to you, even as an alien."
		spaceport "Several tunnels from this spaceport lead off into the distance, though they are guarded by military personnel and identification stations. You presume that they lead to the military facilities established elsewhere on the moon's surface."
	planet "Mavra-Sol-Kvel"
		description "Shielded by the persistent asteroid impacts of this system by its parent gas giant, Mavra-Sol-Kvel enjoys a temperate climate and spectacular vistas. The low gravity here is greatly appreciated by the Successors, and consequently the moon supports a sizable population despite its small size, most of whom live in several cities along the equator."
		description "It is also the seat of power for House Aqrabe, one of the Old Houses. Despite this categorization, House Aqrabe has remained neutral in most of the Successors' conflicts over the millenia, and continues to present itself as an unbiased and politically uncommitted member of the High Houses which, combined with the central position of this star system, has led House Aqrabe to form strong connections with the New Houses as well as the Old."
		add shipyard "Successor Civilian"
		add outfitter "Successor Civilian"
	planet "Mosaa-Oaa-Wyrdd"
		description "Mosaa-Oaa-Wyrdd's location in the only hyperspace link between the northern and southern parts of Successor territory has made it a hub for interstellar trade and the center of Successor commerce."
		description "Unique among all Successor planets, its primary employer is not one of the High Houses but an independent corporation responsible for manufacturing, among other things, the Pulse Laser. The High Houses are understandably somewhat perturbed by this autonomy, but have allowed independent commerce to continue here in exchange for levying modest taxes on transactions that do not go through their official channels."
		spaceport "The spaceport is large and busy, situated at the foot of a mountain, and seems more haphazard than most Successor spaceports you've seen. Small shops and tents sit abreast advertisements for the latest generation of Pulse Laser and statues of important figures in the high houses, many of which seem weather-worn and unmaintained."
		spaceport "At the edges of the port, there is a large ongoing construction project to expand it; you can count dozens of half-completed hangars each large enough for several freighters."

		add outfitter "Successor Civilian"
		add outfitter "Successor Weapons Basics"
		description "Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit was the very first planet in this area of space to be colonized by the Successors' ancestors, and today it boasts a population of over one billion inhabitants, the largest of any planet in Successor space. Its famously mild and forgiving weather supports a strong agricultural economy, and the landscape is dotted with farms both large and small. The primary export of the planet is a long, stringy plant most reminiscent of seaweed, which the Successors consider a staple and consume great quantities of."
		description "Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit is also familial seat to House Myurej, one of the Old Houses."
		spaceport "The spaceport is located right on the equator and is a massive, sprawling affair with several enormous racks of cargo containers stretching out into the distance, clearly awaiting export on soon-arriving freighters. The ground is wet from a sprinkler system that maintains a constant thin film of water all throughout the spaceport's exterior. The Successors, lacking shoes, must appreciate this for reducing friction between their arms and the relatively uncomfortable and rough concrete."
	planet "Staja-Kella-Oa"
		description "Staja-Kella-Oa is widely recognized as the location of the best educational institutions in Successor space, most of which are funded by the Old Houses but accept applications from all Successors regardless of birthplace or family history."
		description "The planet itself is densely forested with a few small cities. Part of the reason that it continues to be a center for education is that it has a rich archaelogical history: this planet was home to a now presumed-extinct sapient species roughly one hundred thousand years ago, and there is a great deal of interest in uncovering the details of their society."
		description "Staja-Kella-Oa is also home to the ancestral estate of House Sioeora, one of the Old Houses."
		spaceport "The dense tree cover shades the landing pads of the spaceport and casts the whole area in dappled light that reflects softly off the moving ships. Much of the traffic at the spaceport is small shuttles and transports carrying Successor students to and from the planet; the interior of it is clean and colorful, and seems directed towards its more youthful audience, with several recruiting posters for the fleets of the various High Houses plastered on the walls."

	### Add full descriptions to uninhabited Successor planets.
	planet Aqra-Kvel-Taaq
		description "Covered in glaciers miles thick and bitterly cold, this planet is little more than a bleak ball of ice too far from its sun to be habitable. In the past, the Successors attempted to set up a shipyard here, but it eventually proved too costly to maintain and too poorly positioned to make up for it. Since it was abandoned, the Successors have made no further attempts to establish facilities here."
	planet Chyyra-Raaqa-Tuur
		description "During the arrival of the New Houses, this planet was briefly considered as a location for permanent habitation. However, the brown dwarf it orbits produces very little heat and makes the planet uncomfortably cold, even for the cold-tolerant Successors. Furthermore, its lack of substantial natural resources exempted it from use as an industrial or mining planet, and it continues to remain uninhabited."
	planet Giiq-Sou-Kella
		description "Small, atmospherically placid, and tectonically stable, this planet is completely covered in a global ocean composed of liquid methane. The inherent toxicity of this environmental feature, combined with the frigid temperatures on its surface and the tiny amount of dry land, have made it unsuitable for long-term habitation."
	planet Khora-Uurau-Uuoru
		description "Thousands of years ago, during the reign of the Predecessors' empire, this moon was used as a weapons testing site. Since the Successors have not invented any novel weapons requiring an entire moon to test since the collapse of the old empire, Khora-Uurau-Uuoru has remained unbombarded since then. Even so, the scars of ancient violence still mar its surface, and its tenuous atmosphere clings desperately to its surface, almost as if it is still terrified of being stripped away."
	planet Khosa-Kella-Oa
		description "Devoid of atmosphere, this small and rocky world sits at the eastern end of Successor space, orbiting a dim star. Because of the Successors' location on the rim of the galaxy, this may very well be the last planet for millions of light years, the furthest child of the Milky Way."
	planet Kuj-Sol-Nnesa
		description "This desert planet is far too hot and arid for the Successors' environmental needs, and its lack of any meaningful deposits of natural resources has precluded its exploitation by mining or industry. It is occasionally visited by Successor researchers, primarily to study the local fauna; giant millipede-like creatures are known to roam the sand here during the twilight hours, hunting anything that moves."
	planet Myiara-Sola-Tej
		description "This industrial station was constructed during the arrival of the New Houses to exploit the mineral wealth of this system, but was abandoned when richer and more accessible mineral deposits were found planetside. It still remains technically habitable, but none of the High Houses have had an interest in refurbishing it since cheaper and easier industrial and habitation projects are constantly available."
	planet Naph-Naap-Kella
		description "This planet is deep in the throes of its early history, with a thick sulfurous atmosphere concealing an unstable and volcanically active surface. Despite that, the Successors have discovered very simple life forms here, possibly the very first life that has developed on this planet. Consequently, it is of some interest to Successor biologists, or at least the ones willing to brave the toxic and destructive conditions on the surface."
	planet "Vade-Osolaa-Kaska"
		description "Although briefly used as a small-scale shipyard several hundred years ago, this station was eventually abandoned by the High Houses because of its inconvenient location and altogether poor construction. There are occasional rumors about criminals using it as a bolt-hole or a place to hide contraband, but few Successors have the desire to go and check."
	planet "Vyraa-Giiq-Sora"
		description "Despite the verdant and often bioluminescent life on its surface, the atmosphere of this planet is highly toxic to the Successors' biochemistry, and so they have made no permanent settlements here. While it is occasionally visited by the odd few tourists who don't mind having to wear an isolation suit, its distance from the majority of Successor space means that the Successors largely leave it alone."
	planet "Vyraa-Viir-Kella"
		description "This planet is being surveyed to establish its potential as a new settlement location for the New Houses. Although its gravity is somewhat high for Successor tastes, it has a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a cool and watery surface. The first few settlers are scheduled to arrive here in a few years, once the planetary surveys are complete and have declared it safe and geologically stable."

	### Update Predecessor planet descriptions to add more lore.
	planet "Kella-Uuoru-Sossa"
		description "This is the ancestral homeworld of the Successor species. The spatial anomalies that now dominate this system have scoured its surface with radiation and evaporated most of its once-extensive oceans. The great cities of the Predecessors' empire are now devoid of all organic life; many of them remain as pristine and gleaming as the on the days they were abandoned. Caustic dust chokes the lower atmosphere of the planet, and your ship's sensors alert you to the presence of several sandstorms at other locations on the planet's surface. It would be wise not to get caught in one."
		spaceport "The planet's main spaceport endures proudly even after thousands of years of disuse. Grand walls and cavernous vaulted ceilings rise hundreds of meters above your ship, some scarred by weapons fire, others distorted by heat or radiation. One flock of small cleaning drones continually polish the sand-worn floors, while others wander about aimlessly, devoid of purpose or direction."
	planet "Osolaa-Val-Mavra"
		description "The moon of Osolaa-Val-Mavra was one of the first worlds of the Predecessors to evacuate as a consequence of the deterioration of their space. House Sejra ran massive transport ships for seven years to and from the surface in an effort to move its citizens offworld and into neighboring systems. By the time they were done, Sejra's coffers were dry and its government on the brink of collapse, and the citizens it had gone to such effort to relocated were stranded in systems that were starting to show the same signs of decay as their one-time home. The desolate habitation trench and ice-covered surface of the moon are testaments to Sejra's folly; of trying to escape something they did not understand and had no hope of stopping."
	planet "Raaqa-Uur-Kaav"
		description "The one-time ancestral home of House Kaatrij is one of the few worlds of the Predecessors that remains relatively habitable. Its large forests have fluorished even in the absence of Kaatrij's intentional ecoengineering, and the enduring remains of the moon's cities are slowly but surely being consumed by the nature that surrounds them. While the advanced materials composing them resist decay even on a timescale of thousands of years, the tender shoots of green life nontheless quietly demonstrate their supremacy over the unmaintained artificial."
		spaceport `What was once this moon's spaceport is now a field of flowers. The landing pad upon which your ship rests has been overtaken by a host of tall blue ribbon-like blossoms for which the Successor name translates to something along the lines of "thread lilies". Nearer what once was the main body of the port, millenia-old flowerboxes are dense with spiky orange blooms that recede when touched and shed seed pods onto the empty walkways, where they are eventually snapped up by the wild gossamer-winged "Kijra"-pets which, like the moon as a whole, have thrived in the absence of their Predecessor masters.`
	planet "Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej"
		description "Once an important industrial planet for the High Houses of the core systems, Cavasaa-Vasa-Tej was a hub for the mining of rare elements and for the growth of exotic metal in the superheated corona of the Kasii-Cavaasa star. Without maintenance, most of the stellar metallic gardens have long since fallen into Kasii-Cavaasa's outer layers, but the few that have survived by chance are now completely overgrown with threads of hyperdense alloy; enough to supply the facilities of Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej's industry for years, if they were still operational."
